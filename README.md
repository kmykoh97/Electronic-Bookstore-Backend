## Technology Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot(for back-end bootstraping)

- MySql(connection using mysql-connector-8)
- MongoDB(Implementation of NoSQL to store comments)
- Hibernate(for automatic database management, JPA implementation and OR mapping)

## IDE

For ease of use, I recommend using Intellj IDEA Ultimate as IDE. All configuration has been set up. Hibernate configuration has been written in application.properties. Please remember to change username, password or server port for your database

## Front-End
